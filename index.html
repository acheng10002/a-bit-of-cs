<!--  most elegant solution becomes important when I start working with large data sets, like when my website 
gets a lot of traffic 

some problems require tools beyond just arrays and iterators

algorithm - set of instructions for solving some problem, step by step

pseudocode - English like syntax that resembles a programming language

compiler - translates the entire source code into machine code before the program is run 
interpreter - directly executes the instructions in written in a programming language without converting them to machine code first

ALGORITHM PSEUDOCODE

// n is variable that is initalized to zero
let n = 0

// start of a loop
for each person in room
 
    // indentation here means this step repeats
    set n = n + 1

ALGORITHM TESTING PHASE
try it with 2 people, and yes it will work
try with a corner case of 0 people, works again


let n = 0
for each pair of people in room
    set n = n + 2
BUT, THIS IS BUGGY BECAUSE THERE'S A MISTAKE, WHAT IF THERE'S AN ODD # OF PPL


let n = 0
for each pair of people in room
    set n = n + 2
// introducing a condition/branch here
if 1 person remains unpaired
    set n = n + 1

phonebook is just a sorted list of names
use binary search to require at most 10 page turns for a 1,000 page phonebook
27 steps for a 1,000,000 page phonebook

computer's processor scales amazingly well

PageRank - algorithm underlying Google search results; crawled the internet and kept track of what other
           websites linked back to a page  
           an important page will have many more links pointing at it than a less important page
           each link is also scored, links from other important pages being worth more than links
           from less important pages 

What part do alorithms play in modern web development, specifically user-based websites?

for typical websites, algorithms are mostly not necessary, although hash tables and other caching methods may be helpful

algorithms become important in web dev when I hae a lot of data that I have to process
ex. Quora search engine or one like it
    once the site gains thousands or millions of users, the search engine would not be able to handle the large
    bandwidth of requests
algorithms also help when I am performing complicated transformations on that data 
ex. I want to develop a CAPTCHA
    if I learn algorithms, I will be better equipped to generates images with blur, ripples, etc. 
    another ex. Google docs, impossible to do real-time text editing without algorithms

algorithsm are an essential characteristic of modern user populated web apps
in order for user-populated web apps to grow big, I need to support a lot of data search, browsing, updating, and deleting
in order to address the issues that come with scaling, I have to use advanced data structures and algorithms 

syntactic token - basic unit of syntax in programming
int x = 5;
int is a keyword
x is an identifier
= is an operator
5 is a literal 
; is a delimiter

recursion - idea that a function calls itself
takes a big problem and starts breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces, and feeds solutions back to the original function
until some sort of answer is achieved and the whole chain unwinds
or when a task can be simplified into an easy action plus a simpler variant of the same task 
or to deal with certain data structures 

any problem that I can solve recursively can be solved using iterators
*some problems break down into too many pieces and overwhelm the computer's memory

limitation of using recursive solutions
what types of problems are more suited for loops than recursion 
what is "recursive depth" - maximal number of nested calls, including the first one 
                            maximal number of contexts in the stack 
what is 'stack overflow' and what it has to do with a recursive problem
